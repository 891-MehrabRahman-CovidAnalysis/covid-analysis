- Thoughtful video on optimizing Spark with partioners on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/scala-spark-big-data/optimizing-with-partitioners-LQT67) by [ScalaCenter @ EPFL](https://scala.epfl.ch/) 
note: to enroll in this, and other EPFL courses for free, select "Audit course".  No credit, but the videos are good for those interested in scala internals.
